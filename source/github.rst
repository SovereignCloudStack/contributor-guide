Collaborating with issues and pull requests
===========================================

We use the GitHub flow to track and discuss changes in issues, then propose and
review changes in pull requests. See the
GitHub documentation (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests)
for more details.
