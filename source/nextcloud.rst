Nextcloud
=========

We have a `nextcloud <https://nextcloud.com>`_
`instance <https://scs.sovereignit.de>`_ for sharing files, calendar, contacts, ...
setup for things that are not public.

We are also using it for our taskboards currently, though we are looking at
options to do this in the open.

If you want to contribute, we'll do an onboarding call and add you to nextcloud.
This will also add you to the scs-member@lists.scs.community mailing list.

We have an announcements mailing list there announce@lists.scs.community and you
can subscribe via the `mailman3 frontend <https://scs.sovereignit.de/mailman3/postorius/lists/>`_
