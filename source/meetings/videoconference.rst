Videoconference
===============

We use a self-hosted `Jitsi <https://jitsi.org>`_ instance for video conferencing.

The server uses an automated deployment based on the
`heat-docker-jitsi-meet <https://github.com/garloff/heat-docker-jitsi-meet>`_ project.

Configuration is such everyone who knows the room can connect, unless the moderator
sets a password/PIN. Opening a new room requires authentication. (Contact Kurt if
you need a password.)

Usage
=====
Connect with a desktop browser (Chrome/Chromium or other blink based browser
recommended due to superior WebRTC implementation with SimulCast/SVC -- 
Safari & Firefox work, but cause higher data traffic). For mobile devices use
the Jitsi Meet App.

Use the little arrows in the control bar at the bottom to select speaker, microphone
and camera in case you lack audio/video.

We have an asterisk connected to some conference rooms to provide dial-in capabilities
for folks that lack internet connectivity (but have a working phone connection).
